Introduction to cpp development:
1. define the problem to solve
2. design a solution
3. write a program that implements the solution
4. compile the program
5. link object files
6. test program
7. debug -> links back to step 4

Compiler does two import tasks:
1. checks cpp code to make sure it follows the rule of the language - if not, compiler gives you an error and the process is aborted
2. translates cpp code into machine language instructions - stored in an intermediate file called an "object file" (typically `.obj` or `.o` extension)

After compiling, the linker kicks in. Linker's job is to combine all of the object files and produce the desired output (linking).
1. linker reads in each of the object files generated by the compiler and checks validity
2. ensures all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly
3. linker typically links in one or more library files (collections of precompiled code that have been packaged up for reuse in other programs)
4. linker outputs the desired output file

For gcc and Clang users:
Add `-ggdb` to the command line for debug builds and `-O2 -DNDEBUG` for release builds.

For GCC and Clang, the `-O#` options is used to control optimization settings. The most common options are as follows:
- `-O0` is the recommended optimization level for debug builds, as it disables optimization. This is the default setting.
- `-O2` is the recommended optimization level for release builds, as it applies optimizations that should be beneficial for all programs
- `-O3` adds additional optimizations that may or may not perform better than `-O2` depending on the specific program

Additional note: you can disable compiler extensions by adding the `-pedantic-errors` flag to the compile command line
Additional note: add the following flags to your command line: `-Wall Weffc++ -Wextra -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Werror`

For GCC/G++/Clang, you can use compiler options `-std=c++11`, `-std=c++14`, `-std=c++17`, `-std=c++20`, `-std=c++23`
